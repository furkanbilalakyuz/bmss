# DIYBMS v4 Programming The Hardware

## Programming the controller (ESP32)

ESP32 controller board uses "Dev Kit C" compatible controller boards using the ESP32-WROOM-32D (4MB)

Suitable boards are available from Amazon

### Code

First step is to upload the main controller code to the ESP32.

You can flash the ESP32 whilst it is connected to the diyBMS controller board, no need to remove.

1. Unplug the ESP32 from its power supply/USB cable
1. If its not already, insert the ESP32 into the controller board, ensure that the ESP's USB connector faces towards the bottom of the board, facing the black ISP connector
1. Download the latest diyBMS ESP32 "Compiled Firmware" ZIP file from [Git Hub Releases](https://github.com/stuartpittaway/diyBMSv4ESP32/releases)
1. Open the ZIP file and extract the file named "esp32-controller-firmware-complete.bin" to your local drive
1. Connect the ESP32 to the computer using a micro USB cable
1. Download the [NodeMCU flasher tool](https://github.com/marcelstoer/nodemcu-pyflasher/releases/) for your operating system
1. Run the program once it has downloaded
1. Select the correct serial port from the list for the ESP32
1. Click Browse and select the file "esp32-controller-firmware-complete.bin"
1. Select the fastest baud rate (pick a slower one if the steps below fail)
1. Select "Dual Output DOUT" for Flash Mode
1. Select "YES" to Erase Flash
1. Click "Flash NodeMCU" and wait

You should see output similar to below:

```
Command: esptool.py --port COM4 --baud 921600 --after no_reset write_flash --flash_mode dout 0x00000 esp32-controller-firmware-complete.bin --erase-all

```

1. Once you see the message "Firmware successfully flashed.", reset the ESP device using the button marked "EN"
1. After a few seconds the LED on the controller board should turn SOLID WHITE, this means the WIFI configuration access point has started


## Connecting To WiFi

diyBMS presents two different methods to configure a WiFi connection to your local router/internet.

### Method 1 - WiFi Access Point
1. Once the white LED light is lit, using a phone/tablet/computer, scan the local WiFi for a new access point named "DIY_BMS_CONTROLLER" and connect to it
1. If using an Android mobile phone, you may want to temporarly switch off "mobile data" as this can sometimes cause problems
1. Using Google Chrome or similar browser, navigate to http://192.168.4.1
1. Using the page which appears, enter the WiFi details for your local network and save them
1. After the settings are saved, the ESP32 reboots and the LED should change to GREEN and flash on and off occasionally
1. Back on your computer/tablet/phone, connect back to your normal WiFi connection/local network and using Chrome browser or similar, navigate to the IP address of the ESP device.  You may have to check on your Internet router, what IP address has been assigned to the device by DHCP.

### Method 2 - Terminal/Serial Port - using USB cable
1. Download a terminal emulator like Putty or similar, which can be used to communicate over serial ports.  The Arduino IDE can also be used, in Serial Monitor mode.
1. Make a note of the serial port used whilst programming the device (COM4 in the example above)
1. Open the terminal emulator (Putty for example) and type in the name of the serial port COM4, and the settings baud rate=115200, 8 data bits, No parity, 1 Stop bit
1. Click Open/Connect
1. On the ESP32, press the "EN" button to reboot it
1. On the terminal emulator, you should see messages across the screen, like below:

```

Press SPACE BAR to enter terminal based configuration..............
```

1. Quickly tap the SPACE BAR to start configuration.  You have about 3 seconds to do this.  The controller will scan the local WiFi access points and present a list, like below.

```

 0:myhomewifi                           1:WIFI
 2:private-wifi                         3:Virgin Media

10:VM11122
Enter the NUMBER of the Wifi network to connect to:
```

1. Type the number (not name) of the access point to connect to
1. When prompted, enter the access point password (asterisk characters will appear on screen)

```
Enter the password to use when connecting to 'TALKTALK': ******************
```

1. After the settings are saved, the controller reboots
1. A lot of messages will be shown on screen, however "Wi-Fi status=3" means that the controller has connected to the access point
1. You can also navigate using a web browser to the DIYBMS interface using the IP address listed in the log files - example below is http://192.168.0.68

```

```

1. If the controller fails to connect, you can repeat the whole process to reconfigure as needed

Note when the BMS asks for the wifi details, you have 30 seconds to enter them before the controller reboots


## Programming the modules

The ESP32 controller supports programming the cell monitoring modules directly, you no longer need to use a computer or USBASP style cable/adapter.
